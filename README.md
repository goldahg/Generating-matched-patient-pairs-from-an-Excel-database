Our lab has a bank of 3000 placental samples from 8 different hospitals, including various delivery states and pathologies for research purposes. Each sample has about 20 parameters associated with time of delivery, presence or absence of different types of diseases (obstetric and otherwise), previous experiences of the mother during childbirth, COVID vaccinations, etc. To study specific placental pathologies, the proper samples must be found according to all of these criteria, and, crucially, a matched control must be found for each pathological sample, i.e. one that is similar to the pathological sample in every way except for the pathology in question. We would like to create an algorithm that generates matches between pathological samples and controls based on all these parameters and the experimental need determined by the user.
This would be very useful to our research aims as we have recently done it manually and spent many hours finding the right samples.
